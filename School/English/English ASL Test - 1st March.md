Indian education is at a point of uncertainty, which sounds tame as it is. But the drastic consequences of the in capabilities of those higher end up falling on the backs of the children of our generation. 

I think the biggest issue with the Indian education system is that it ruins learning for everyone who attends it. The aim of our education is not to learn something new, but rather to memorize something blindly and reproduce it during an exam. Most of what we learn is pointless, a waste of times, and frankly completely irrelevant in today's world. 

After the 12 futile years you spend at a school in India, you are left with 0 skills, 0 accomplishments and a certificate that you will most likely never look at in your life again. And most importantly, that voracity to learn that you once might have had is now crushed by the pointless exams and stress that you endured for so long.

What an ideal education system should be doing is identifying a student's strengths and growth points, and nurturing the same so that after they finish their schooling they have a skill or a strength that has actual value in the real value.

Because the reality of the situation, nobody cares if you can memorize a chemistry practical and do it in under 3 hours. No one cares how many words you wrote in your English essay. In today's world what matters is real-life problem-solving skills, the ability to adapt and most importantly the hunger to learn. 

But all our education system has been doing for the past decade is fund the massive brain drain our country suffers from.
