- Indian education is at a point of uncertainty, which sounds tame as it is. But the drastic consequences of the in capabilities of those higher end up falling on the backs of the children of our generation. 

- I think the biggest issue with the Indian education system is that it ruins learning for everyone who attends it. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The aim of our education is not to learn something new, but rather to memorize something blindly and reproduce it during an exam. Most of what we learn is pointless, a waste of time, and frankly completely irrelevant in today's world. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- After the 12 futile years you spend at a school in India, you are left with 0 skills, severe burnout and a certificate that you will most likely never look at in your life again. 

- And most importantly, that voracity to learn that you once might have had is now crushed by the pointless exams and stress that you endured for so long.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What an ideal education system should be doing is identifying a student's strengths and growth points, and nurturing the same so that after they finish their schooling they have a skill or a strength that has actual value in the real world.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Because the reality of the situation is that, nobody cares that you can memorize a chemistry practical and do it under 3 hours. No one cares how many words you wrote in your English essay. 

- In today's world what matters is real-life problem-solving skills, the ability to adapt and most importantly the hunger to learn. 

- But all our education system has been doing for the past decade is fund the massive brain drain our country suffers from. 
- It creates workers, not thinkers. 
- Our outdated education system is one of the major reasons why we fail to emerge as a developed nation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conclusion, it is clear that the Indian education system is not adequately preparing students for the challenges they will face in the future. There is a need for significant reforms to address this issue. We need to move away from the traditional approach of rote learning and focus more on developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and other 21st-century skills.
