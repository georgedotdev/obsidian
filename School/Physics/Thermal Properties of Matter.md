*thermodynamics means heat in motion or transfer of heat*

### Temperature 
- temperature is the measure of degree of hotness or coldness of a body

###  Heat
- heat is a form of energy which flows from hotter body to colder body
- SI unit  - Joules(J)
- **1 Joule = 4.2 calorie(cal)**

#### Calorie
*one calorie is equal to the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1$\degree$ celsius*

### Caloric theory of heat
- heat is an invisible fluid which flows from one body to another
- heat transfers from hot to cold in equilibrium
But this theory was outdated after bejamin thompsons thermodynamics whic states that *heat can be transfered into work and wrok into heat*
- Note : energy is the ability to do work

### Mesurement of Temperature
- Ice point : temp at which pure water freezes
- Steam point : temp at which pure water boils
-  0$\degree$ celsius - ice point of water
- 100$\degree$ celsius - steam point of water
- To convert from Kelvin to celsium $\Rightarrow T_{k}= T_{C}+273$

## Ideal Gas Equation

Charecteristics of a gas which describe its behavious - pressure, volume and temperature
And the relation between these characteristics is given by
1. Boyle's Law : according to this law $$p \propto \frac {1}{v}$$
$$\implies pV = constant$$
2. Charles Law : according to this law $$V \propto T$$
$$\implies \frac{V}{T} = constant$$
on combining these two laws we get the ideal gas equation
