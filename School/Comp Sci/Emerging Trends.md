## Artificial Intelligence

- Endeavours to simulate the natural intelligence of human beings into machines, thus making them behave intelligently
- imitates cognitive functions of human beings like learning, decision-making and problem-solving
- AI is programmed to create a knowledge base and make decisions based on it, it also makes decisions based on experiences

### Machine learning

- Is a subsystem of artificial intelligence
- ability to learn from date using statistical techniques
- algorithms called models are tested and after successive training they are used to making predictions about new and unknown data

## Natural Language processing

- Predictive typing features, spell checking features and typing are all examples of *NLP*
- deals with the interaction between computer and humans using human spoken languages
- **emerging applications of NLP :**
			1. Text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversions
			2. Language translation (translating texts from different languages)
			3. Automated customer service(computer interact with customers to service queries)

## Immersive Experiences

### Virtual Reality
- Is a three-dimensional, computer generated situation that simulates the real world
- user can interact with and explore the environment by getting immersed in it
- achieved with the help of VR headsets

### Augmented Reality
- The superimposition of computer generated perceptual information over the existing physical surroundings is called as Augmented Reality(AR)
- adds components of the digital world to the physical world

## Robotics

- a machine capable of carrying out one or more tasks automatically with accuracy and precision
- robot is programmable by a computer, which means it can follow instructions given through other computer programs
- initially conceptualized for doing boring/repetitive tasks or tasks that were labor intensive for humans, thereby replacing them in those
- Examples : 
	- NASA's mars exploration rover (MER)
	- Sophia - humanoid that uses artificial intelligence
	- Drones

## Big Data

With huge amounts of data being created every day, it results in a generation of data sets of Enormous volume and complexity called *Big Data*

Such data cannot be processed using traditional data processing tools as the data is not only voluminous but also unstructured

Big data also represents various challenges like integrations, storage, analysis, searching, processing, transfer, querying and visualization of the data

### Characteristics of Big Data

There are 5 characteristics of Big Data that distinguishes it from traditional data :

- **Volume :** If a particular dataset is of such a large size that it is difficult to process using traditional DBMS tools, then it is termed Big Data
- **Velocity :** Big Data has an exponentially high rate of generation than traditional data sets
- **Variety :** It asserts that a dataset has varied data like unstructured, semi structures and structured
- **Veracity :** Big data can sometimes be inconsistent, biased, noisy and abnormal. Veracity refers to the trustworthiness of the data
- **Value :** possesses hidden pattern and useful knowledge that maybe of high business value

### Data Analytics

Is the process of examining datasets in order to draw conclusions about information that they contain, with the aid of specialized systems and software

- used in commercial industries to make informed business decisions
- useful for researchers to verify or disprove scientific models

Pandas is a library of the programming language in python that can be used as a tool to make data analysis much simpler

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Is a Network of devices that have embedded hardware and software to communicate with other devices on the network

Example : IoT bringing together appliances in a home which contain microcontrollers which when brought together using a network all con be used in accord with each other

### Web of Things (WoT)

Web of things allows the use of web services to connect anything in the human world, removes the need for 'n' number of apps for 'n' number of devices

## Sensors
Sensors are very commonly used as monitoring and observing elements in real world applications.

A smart sensor is a device that takes input from the physical environment and uses built in computing resources to perform predefined functions for a specific input

## Smart Cities
The idea of smart cities makes use of computer and communication tech along with IoT to distribute resources efficiently.

## Cloud Computing
- Is an emerging trend where computer based services are delivered over the internet or the *cloud*, accessible to a user from anywhere using any device
- Services include software, hardware servers, databases, storage etc.
- provided by cloud service providers and usually charge on pay per use bases
- example : using cloud services to store our pictures and files on the internet as backup
- Through cloud computing users can run bigger apps or process large amounts of data without having the required storage power
