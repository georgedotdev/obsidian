# Thrust

- molecules in a liquid are in random motion due to their thermal velocities
- constantly collidiing with walls of container and rebounding

*The normal change in momentum transfered to the walls of the container by molecules o fhte fluid is called thrust of the fluid on the container*

## Liquid in Enquilibrium 

*When a liquid is equilibrium the net force acting on it will always be perpendicular to its surface*
- F cos$\theta$ - tangential component acting parallel to the surface
- F sin$\theta$ - normal component acting perpendicula to the surface

# Pressure
*pressure of a liquid at a point is the thrust exerted by the liquid at rest per unit area*

- if total force F acts normally over a flat area A then pressure is,
			$Pressure,p  = \frac {thrust}{area} = \frac {F}{A}$
- unit of pressure is dyne/cm^2	
- 1 Pa(1 N/m^2) = 10 dyne/cm^2
- 1 atm = 1.013 * 10^5 N/m^2
- **pressure is not a scalar quantity*

# Density and Relative density

*defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance*
*denoted by $\rho$ *

If M is the mass of the substance and volume V, then density,
$$Density, \rho = \frac {M}{V}$$
SI Unit of density is $\frac {kg}{m^3}$

## Relative Density or Specific Gravity

*ratio of density of that substance to the density of wateer*
$$relative \:Density = \frac {density\:Of\:Substance}{density \: of \: water}$$
density of water - $1000  kg \per m^3$

---
# Pascals Law

*the pressure applied to an enclosed fluid  is transmitted equaly and undiminished to every portion of the fluid and also to the walls of the container*

$$\frac {F_1}{A_1} = \frac {F_2}{A_2}$$
- pressure is not a vector quantity because no direction can be assigned to it
