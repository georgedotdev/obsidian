Elasticity
---
The property of matter by virtue of which it regains its original shape and size when the deforming forces have been removed is called elasticity.
- Deformation due to elasticity is known as elastic deformation
- Examples of elastic bodies - Quartz fiber, ivory ball and phosphor bronze

Plasticity
---
The property of a body but virtue of which it does not regain its original shape and size even after the removal of deforming force is called plasticity.
- Examples of plastic bodies - putty, paraffin wax, mud and quartz are nearly perfect plastic bodies

## Elastic Behavior of Solids
- Atoms are held together by intermolecular forces
- these forces keep solid in *equilibrium* position
- Deformation causes change in intermolecular distances

## Spring ball model of solids
- let the atoms in a solid be small balls connecting in 3-D space through springs.
- ![Spring ball model|170](https://haygot.s3.amazonaws.com/questions/585515_508992_ans.png)
- When a ball is displaced from equilibrium position the springs connected to it exert a restoring force moving it back to its equilibrium position.
- Robert hook found that Elongation in a body ‚àù applied force

# Stress

*the internal restoring force acting per unit area of a deformed body is called stress*

- If there is no permanent change in the body(no plastic behaviour), the restoring force is euqal and opposite to the deforming force applied therefore euqation of stress can be given by
$$Stress = \frac {External Deforming force}{Area of cross section}$$
$$stress = \frac {F}{A}$$

 SI Unit = $\frac {N}{m^{2}}$ or Pascal(Pa)   Dimensions = $[ML^(-1)T^(-2)]$
 - stress is not a vector quantity
 --- 
On the basis of applied forces on the body stress can be classified as 

## Longitudinal Stress

- Deforming force applied normal to the surface area
- Causes change in length and linear density but not in chape and mass
- $Longitudinal Stress = \frac {external Deforming force}{erea of cross section}$ or $= \frac {F}{A}$
	#### Tensile Stress
- Consider a circular rod of lenght *l* , if an euqal and opssite force is applied to norma to the cross sectional area to increase its length then final lenght of rod  becomed $l + \delta l$
	#### Compressive Stress
- In the same ciruclar rod if two equal and opposite forces are applied to compress it then it is known as compressive stress and the length of the rod is $l -\delta l$
- decrease in lenght of rod is $\delta l$

## Shearing Stress

- deforming forca aplied parallel to the surface area
- produces a change in shape but no change in volume
- $Shearing stress = \frac {F}{A}$

## Hydraulic Stress or Bulk Stress

- body is subjected to uniform force from all sides 
- change in volume but no change in shape 
- $bulk Stress = \frac {External Deforming force}{Area of cross section} = hydraulicPressure$
- due to force being applied perpendicular to every point there is a change in volume $\delta v$
-

# Strain

*change in dimensions of a body due to stress*

$$Strain = \frac{changeInDimension}{originalDimension}$$
- strain has no unit or dimension
- is the ratio of two quantities
Accoringing to a change in configuration(change in lengh, volume or shape,) strain can be classified as 

## Longitudinal Strain

- defined as the change in lenght per unit original length 
$$longitudinalStrain = \frac {changeInLength}{originalLength} = \frac {\delta L}{L}$$
## Volumetric Strain

- defined as change in volume per unit original volume
$$volumetricStrain = \frac {changeInVolume}{originalVolume} = \frac {\delta V}{V}$$
## Shear Strain

- ratio of relative displacement ($\delta L$) to length of the side $l$
- shear strain is defined by $tan \theta$
- the angle $\theta$ is called angle of shear
$$shear Strain = tan\theta = \frac {\delta L}{L}$$
- **the strain produced in a spring is longitudinal as well as shear if the string is stretched by suspending a load at its free end**
- **strain persists even when stress is removed and thus lags behind stress**

# Hooke's Law

*Hooke's law states that extension produced in the wire is directly proportional to the load applied within defined limit of elasticity*
$$extenion \propto load Applied$$
Later on it was found that law is appplicable to all types of deformation and thus a modified form,
*within elastic limit, the stress developed is directly proportional to the strain produced in a body*
$$stress \propto strain $$
$$\Rightarrow stress = E \times Strain$$
$$\Rightarrow E = \frac {Stress}{Strain}$$
where E is a constant known as **Modulus of Elasticity**

# Stress-Strain curve

![Stress-strain graph | 600](https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/09085449/HoL2.jpg)

- hooke's law is valid until elastic limit
- from A to B even for a small increase in stress there is a large strin upto point B
- Region OB is elastic region
- After point B body will not return to original shape or size and deformation is permanent
- Region CE is plastic region
- Wire will break at point E wchi is fracture point 
- stress needed to cause the actual fracture of the material is called ultimate tensile strength

---
On the basis of elastic and plastic properties, material can be classified in two ways.

## Ductile Materials

- Materials which has large plastic range of extension
- Fracture point is widely seperated from elastic limit
- such materials undergo irreversible increase in lenght before snapping. So they can be drawn into thin wires
- example - copper, silver, aluminium, iron etc.
![stress-strain curve for ductile material | 400](https://www.rgpvonline.com/answer/basic-mechanical-engineering/img/28-1.jpg)


## Brittle Materials

- materials which have very small range of plastic extension
- material breaks as soon as the stress is increased beyond elastic limit
- breaking point lies close to elastic limit
- example - glass, ceramics, cast iron etc.

# Modulus of elasticity

*defined as the ratio of stress to the corresponding strain within the elastic limit*
SI Unit = $\frac {N}{m^{2}}$ or Pascal(Pa)   Dimensions = $[ML^(-1)T^(-2)]$
- depends on the nature of the material of the body
- modulus is independent of its dimensions (i.e length,area, volume etc.)

There are three types of modulus of elasticity,

##  Young's Modulus of elasticity

*within elastic limit the ratio of logitudinal stress to longitudinal strain is youngs modulus of the material of the wire*

$$Young's modulus = \frac {longitudinalStress}{longitudinalStrain}$$

Consider a wire of length *l* and raidus *r*. Let a Force *F* be appllied on the wire normal to the surface, then $\delta L$ is the change in length of the wire
$$\therefore Young's Modulus,$$
$$Y = \frac {F/A}{\delta L/L}$$
putting F = mg and A = $\pi \times r^2$
$$Y = \frac {mgL}{\pi r^{2}\delta L}$$
or $$Y = \frac {FL}{\pi r^{2}\delta L}$$

# Bulk modulus of elasticity

*within elastic limit the ratio of normal stress to volumetric strain is called bulk modulus*

conside a body of volume V and surface area A suppose force F acts uniformly over the body and decreases volume by $\delta V$, then bulk modulus is given by
$$B = \frac {F/A}{\delta V/V}$$
$$\therefore BulkModulus = \frac {-F}{A} \times \frac {V}{\delta V}$$
$$\Rightarrow B = \frac {-pV}{\delta V}$$
where $p = \frac {F}{A}$
- **negative sign shows that volume decreases with increase in stress, but for a system in equilibrium bulk modulus is always positive**
- **bulk modulus for a perfect rigid and ideal liquid is always infinite**

### Compressability
*The reciprocal of bulk modulus of a material is called its compressability*

$$Compressability = \frac {1}{B} = \frac {- \delta V}{pV}$$
SI unit = 1/Nm^2
- **when compressability is given in the question, usually it is given in atm, to convert atm to Newtons per metre square : multiply by 1.1013 * 10 ^5 **
- **use this to convert any atm value to newtons per metre square**

## Modulus of Rigidity or Shear Modulus
*ratio of shear stress to shear strain*
- it is denoted as G or n

$$ G = \frac {shearStress}{shearStrain}$$
$$Shear modulus ,G = \frac {F}{A} \times \frac {L}{\delta L}$$
- **shear modulus of an ideal liquid is 0**
- **solids have all types of modulus of elasticity but fluids(liquids and gases) only has bulkmodulus of elasticity**
